# Mesa

##### Mesa is an Apache2 licensed agent-based modeling (ABM) framework in Python.

Mesa allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components (such as **spatial grids** and **agent schedulers**); visualize them using a browser-based interface; and analyze their results using Python's data analysis tools.
