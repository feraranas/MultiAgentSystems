# Forest Fire

This agent-based model simulates a forest fire. We use `agentpy` library to work with a spatial grid and create animations, and perform a parameter sweep.

```python
# Model design
import agentpy as ap

# Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import IPython
```

# About the model

The model is based on the NetLogo FireSimple model by Uri Wilensky and William Rand, who describe it as follows:

> This model simulates the spread of a fire through a forest. It shows that the fire's chance of reaching the right edge of the forest depends critically on the density of trees. This is an example of a common feature of complex systems, the presence of a non-linear threshold or critical parameter. [...]

> The fire starts on the left edge of the forest, and spreads to neighboring trees. The fire spreads in four directions: **north, east, south, and west**.

> The model assumes there is no wind. So, the fire must have trees along its path in order to advance. That is, the fire cannot skip over an unwooded area (patch), so such a patch blocks the fire's motion in that direction.

#### Defining the model

```python
# Define parameters

parameters = {
    'Tree density': 0.6, # Percentage of grid covered by trees
    'size': 50, # Height and length of the grid
    'steps': 100,
}
```

```python
class ForestModel(ap.Model):

     def setup(self):
          
          # Create agents (trees).
          n_trees = int(self.p['Tree density'] * (self.p.size ** 2))
          trees = self.agents = ap.AgentList(self, n_trees)

          # Create grid (forest)
          self.forest = ap.Grid(self, [self.p.size] * 2, track_empty = True)
          self.forest.add_agents(trees, random = True, empty = True)

          # Initiate a dynamic variable for all trees
          # Condition 0: Alive, Condition 1: Burning, Condition 2: Burned
          self.agents.condition = 0

          # Start a fire from the left side of the grid
          unfortunate_trees = self.forest.agents[0:self.p.size, 0:2]
          unfortunate_trees.condition = 1
          
     def step(self):

          # Select burning trees
          burning_trees = self.agents.select(self.agents.condition == 1)

          # Spread fire
          for tree in burning_trees:
               for neighbor in self.forest.neighbors(tree):
                    if neighbor.condition == 0:
                         neighbor.condition = 1 # Neighbor starts burning
               tree.condition = 2 # Tree burns out
          
          # Stop simulation if no fire is left
          if len(burning_trees) == 0:
               self.stop()
     
     def end(self):

          # Document a measure at the end of the simulation
          burned_trees = len(self.agents.select(self.agents.condition == 2))

          self.report('Porcentage of burned trees', burned_trees / len(self.agents))
```

```python
# Create a single run animation with custom colors
def animation_plot(model, ax):
     attr_grid = model.forest.attr_grid('condition')
     color_dict = {0: '#7FC97F', 1: '#d62c2c', 2: '#e5e5e5', None: '#d5e5d5'}
     ap.gridplot(attr_grid, ax=ax, color_dict=color_dict, convert=True)
     ax.set_title(f"Simulation of a forest fire\n"
                  f"Time-step: {model.t}, Trees left: "
                  f"{len(model.agents.select(model.agents.condition == 0))}")
```

```python
# Instancia del modelo y Gr√°fica animada
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
model = ForestModel(parameters)
animation = ap.animate(model, fig, ax, animation_plot)
IPython.display.HTML(animation.to_jshtml(fps=15))
```
